      <description>You walk into a tavern and roll a dice.
Hello and welcome to the Dragons Not Included podcast.
We are a group of friends with a mutual love of tabletop roleplaying games. We wanted to bring the experience of playing a game with us around the table to you at home.
So we hope you will join us with the action, the drama and the laughs through the Wrath of the Righteous adventure path.</description>
