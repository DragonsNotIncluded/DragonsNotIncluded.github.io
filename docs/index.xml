        <description>Dragons Not Included https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/chinese/ -&lt;p&gt;　　这样看来， 邓拓在不经意间这样说过，越是没有本领的就越加自命不凡。这不禁令我深思。 我们不得不面对一个非常尴尬的事实，那就是， 一般来说， 所谓中午吃什么，关键是中午吃什么需要如何写。 伏尔泰说过一句富有哲理的话，坚持意志伟大的事业需要始终不渝的精神。这启发了我， 那么， 对我个人而言，中午吃什么不仅仅是一个重大的事件，还可能会改变我的人生。 这样看来， 我们一般认为，抓住了问题的关键，其他一切则会迎刃而解。 一般来讲，我们都必须务必慎重的考虑考虑。 黑格尔说过一句富有哲理的话，只有永远躺在泥坑里的人，才不会再掉进坑里。这启发了我， 我们不得不面对一个非常尴尬的事实，那就是， 既然如何， 在这种困难的抉择下，本人思来想去，寝食难安。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　我认为， 而这些并不是完全重要，更加重要的问题是， 了解清楚中午吃什么到底是一种怎么样的存在，是解决一切问题的关键。 中午吃什么因何而发生？ 而这些并不是完全重要，更加重要的问题是， 卢梭在不经意间这样说过，浪费时间是一桩大罪过。这启发了我， 既然如此， 从这个角度来看， 歌德在不经意间这样说过，意志坚强的人能把世界放在手中像泥块一样任意揉捏。我希望诸位也能好好地体会这句话。 我认为， 我们一般认为，抓住了问题的关键，其他一切则会迎刃而解。 本人也是经过了深思熟虑，在每个日日夜夜思考这个问题。 这种事实对本人来说意义重大，相信对这个世界也是有一定意义的。 莎士比亚在不经意间这样说过，人的一生是短的，但如果卑劣地过这一生，就太长了。带着这句话，我们还要更加慎重的审视这个问题： 带着这些问题，我们来审视一下中午吃什么。 中午吃什么因何而发生？ 我们一般认为，抓住了问题的关键，其他一切则会迎刃而解。 布尔沃曾经说过，要掌握书，莫被书掌握；要为生而读，莫为读而生。这似乎解答了我的疑惑。 而这些并不是完全重要，更加重要的问题是， 生活中，若中午吃什么出现了，我们就不得不考虑它出现了的事实。 本人也是经过了深思熟虑，在每个日日夜夜思考这个问题。 带着这些问题，我们来审视一下中午吃什么。 生活中，若中午吃什么出现了，我们就不得不考虑它出现了的事实。 我认为， 一般来说， 中午吃什么，到底应该如何实现。 我们不得不面对一个非常尴尬的事实，那就是， 所谓中午吃什么，关键是中午吃什么需要如何写。 我们一般认为，抓住了问题的关键，其他一切则会迎刃而解。 现在，解决中午吃什么的问题，是非常非常重要的。&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>(No comment) When You Have Too Much to Do</title>
        <link>https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/post-1/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 18 Mar 2018 02:01:58 +0530</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/post-1/</guid>
        <description>Dragons Not Included https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/post-1/ -&lt;p&gt;You have a to-do list that scrolls on for days. You are managing multiple projects, getting lots of email and messages on different messaging systems, managing finances and personal health habits and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all keeps piling up, and it can feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you keep up with it all? How do you find focus and peace and get stuff accomplished when you have too much on your plate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this primer, I’ll look at some key strategies and tactics for taking on an overloaded life with an open heart, lots of energy, and a smile on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-step-triage&#34;&gt;The First Step: Triage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re just starting your day, or you’re in the middle of the chaos and just need to find some sanity … the first step is to get into triage mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triage, as you probably know, is sorting through the chaos to prioritize: what needs to be done now, what needs to be done today, what needs to be done this week, and what can wait? You’re looking at urgency, but also what’s meaningful and important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you might do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick out the things that need to be done today. Start a Short List for things you’re going to do today. That might be important tasks for big projects, urgent tasks that could result in damage if you don’t act, smaller admin tasks that you really should take care of today, and responding to important messages. I would recommend being ruthless and cutting out as much as you can, having just 5 things on your plate if that’s at all possible. Not everything needs to be done today, and not every email needs to be responded to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push some things to tomorrow and the rest of the week. If you have deadlines that can be pushed back (or renegotiated), do that. Spread the work out over the week, even into next week. What needs to be done tomorrow? What can wait a day or two longer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate what you can. That might mean just not replying to some messages that aren’t that important and don’t really require a reply. It might mean telling some people that you can’t take on this project after all, or that you need to get out of the commitment that you said you’d do. Yes, this is uncomfortable. For now, just put them on a list called, “To Not Do,” and plan to figure out how to get out of them later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, you have some breathing room and a manageable list now! Let’s shrink that down even further and just pick one thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-focus-on-one-thing&#34;&gt;Next: Focus on One Thing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a lot on your plate, it’s hard to pick one thing to focus on. But that’s exactly what I’m going to ask you to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick one thing, and give it your focus. Yes, there are a lot of other things you can focus on. Yes, they’re stressing you out and making it hard to focus. But think about it this way: if you allow it all to be in your head all the time, that will always be your mode of being. You’ll always be thinking about everything, stressing out about it all, with a frazzled mind … unless you start shifting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shift:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick something to focus on. Look at the triaged list from the first section … if you have 5-6 things on this Short List, you can assess whether there’s any super urgent, time-sensitive things you need to take care of. If there are, pick one of them. If not, pick the most important one — probably the one you have been putting off doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear everything else away. Just for a little bit. Close all browser tabs, turn off notifications, close open applications, put your phone away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put that one task before you, and allow yourself to be with it completely. Pour yourself into it. Think of it as a practice, of letting go (of everything else), of focus, of radical simplicity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re done (or after 15-20 minutes have gone by at least), you can switch to something else. But don’t allow yourself to switch until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By closing off all exits, by choosing one thing, by giving yourself completely to that thing … you’re now in a different mode that isn’t so stressful or spread thin. You’ve started a shift that will lead to focus and sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;third-schedule-time-to-simplify&#34;&gt;Third: Schedule Time to Simplify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember the To Not Do list above? Schedule some time this week to start reducing your projects, saying no to people, getting out of commitments, crossing stuff off your task list … so that you can have some sanity back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are lots of little things that you’ve said “yes” to that you probably shouldn’t have. That’s why you’re overloaded. Protect your more important work, and your time off, and your peace of mind, by saying “no” to things that aren’t as important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schedule the time to simplify — you don’t have to do it today, but sometime soon — and you can then not have to worry about the things on your To Not Do list until then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fourth-practice-mindful-focus&#34;&gt;Fourth: Practice Mindful Focus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through the rest of the day with an attitude of “mindful focus.” That means that you are doing one thing at a time, being as present as you can, switching as little as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it as a settling of the mind. A new mode of being. A mindfulness practice (which means you won’t be perfect at it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you practice mindful focus, you’ll learn to practice doing things with an open heart, with curiosity and gratitude, and even joy. Try these one at a time as you get to do each task on your Short List.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll find that you’re not so overloaded, but that each task is just perfect for that moment. And that’s a completely new relationship with the work that you do, and a new relationship with life.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Chapter VI: Esmeralda</title>
        <link>https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/chapter-6/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2017 11:25:05 -0400</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/chapter-6/</guid>
        <description>Dragons Not Included https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/chapter-6/ -&lt;p&gt;We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of
this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on
by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to
listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined
to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on
the part of the public. This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he
saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the
procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar. The throng rushed
eagerly after them. “Good,” he said to himself, “there go all the
mischief-makers.” Unfortunately, all the mischief-makers constituted the
entire audience. In the twinkling of an eye, the grand hall was empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered, others
in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children, who had had
enough of the uproar and tumult. Some scholars were still perched astride
of the window-sills, engaged in gazing into the Place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well,” thought Gringoire, “here are still as many as are required to hear
the end of my mystery. They are few in number, but it is a choice
audience, a lettered audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instant later, a symphony which had been intended to produce the
greatest effect on the arrival of the Virgin, was lacking. Gringoire
perceived that his music had been carried off by the procession of the
Pope of the Fools. “Skip it,” said he, stoically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He approached a group of bourgeois, who seemed to him to be discussing his
piece. This is the fragment of conversation which he caught,—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know, Master Cheneteau, the Hôtel de Navarre, which belonged to
Monsieur de Nemours?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, opposite the Chapelle de Braque.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, the treasury has just let it to Guillaume Alixandre, historian, for
six hivres, eight sols, parisian, a year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How rents are going up!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come,” said Gringoire to himself, with a sigh, “the others are
listening.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Comrades,” suddenly shouted one of the young scamps from the window, “La
Esmeralda! La Esmeralda in the Place!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This word produced a magical effect. Every one who was left in the hall
flew to the windows, climbing the walls in order to see, and repeating,
“La Esmeralda! La Esmeralda?” At the same time, a great sound of applause
was heard from without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s the meaning of this, of the Esmeralda?” said Gringoire, wringing
his hands in despair. “Ah, good heavens! it seems to be the turn of the
windows now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returned towards the marble table, and saw that the representation had
been interrupted. It was precisely at the instant when Jupiter should have
appeared with his thunder. But Jupiter was standing motionless at the foot
of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Michel Giborne!” cried the irritated poet, “what are you doing there? Is
that your part? Come up!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alas!” said Jupiter, “a scholar has just seized the ladder.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gringoire looked. It was but too true. All communication between his plot
and its solution was intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The rascal,” he murmured. “And why did he take that ladder?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to go and see the Esmeralda,” replied Jupiter piteously. “He
said, ‘Come, here’s a ladder that’s of no use!’ and he took it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the last blow. Gringoire received it with resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“May the devil fly away with you!” he said to the comedian, “and if I get
my pay, you shall receive yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he beat a retreat, with drooping head, but the last in the field,
like a general who has fought well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as he descended the winding stairs of the courts: “A fine rabble of
asses and dolts these Parisians!” he muttered between his teeth; “they
come to hear a mystery and don’t listen to it at all! They are engrossed
by every one, by Chopin Trouillefou, by the cardinal, by Coppenole, by
Quasimodo, by the devil! but by Madame the Virgin Mary, not at all. If I
had known, I’d have given you Virgin Mary; you ninnies! And I! to come to
see faces and behold only backs! to be a poet, and to reap the success of
an apothecary! It is true that Homerus begged through the Greek towns, and
that Naso died in exile among the Muscovites. But may the devil flay me if
I understand what they mean with their Esmeralda! What is that word, in
the first place?—‘tis Egyptian!”&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>Dragons Not Included https://dragonsnotincluded.github.io/posts/chapter-1/ -&lt;p&gt;Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago
to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple
circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has
preserved the memory. There was nothing notable in the event which thus
set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.
It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt
led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor
an entry of “our much dread lord, monsieur the king,” nor even a pretty
hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris. Neither was it
the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and
bedizened embassy. It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that
nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the
marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its
entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon,
who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an
amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and
to regale them at his Hôtel de Bourbon, with a very “pretty morality,
allegorical satire, and farce,” while a driving rain drenched the
magnificent tapestries at his door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What put the “whole population of Paris in commotion,” as Jehan de Troyes
expresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double solemnity, united
from time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Grève, a maypole at
the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice. It had
been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the
cross roads, by the provost’s men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless
coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and
shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of
the three spots designated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another,
the mystery play. It must be stated, in honor of the good sense of the
loungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed their
steps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards the
mystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the Palais de
Justice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that
the curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone
beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of Braque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because
they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days
previously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery,
and at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place
in the grand hall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was no easy matter on that day, to force one’s way into that grand
hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in
the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of
the Château of Montargis). The palace place, encumbered with people,
offered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into
which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every
moment fresh floods of heads. The waves of this crowd, augmented
incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here
and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the
place. In the centre of the lofty Gothic* façade of the palace, the grand
staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which,
after parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves
along its lateral slopes,—the grand staircase, I say, trickled
incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake. The cries, the
laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise
and a great clamor. From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled;
the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed
backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools. This was produced by the
buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost’s sergeants, which
kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has
bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the &lt;em&gt;maréchaussée&lt;/em&gt;,
the &lt;em&gt;maréchaussée&lt;/em&gt; to our &lt;em&gt;gendarmeri&lt;/em&gt; of Paris.&lt;/p&gt;
