At first glance Istra might seem like a typical warrior of Gorum, but she quickly proves herself to be anything but. A fearless, headstrong kellid woman who lives for battle but has a deep care for even the smallest animals. A tough appearance at a glance but always has the widest smile in the room. She has a cavalier attitude to her own safety and would lay down her life for her companions, but that wont stop her teasing them for it afterwards. There may be more to Istra than first meets the eye and the party have only just scratched the surface.
