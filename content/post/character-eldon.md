Bravery. Honour. Piety. All qualities the Aegis family strived to be examplars of since they first emerged on Golarion. The Aegis' have fought under the banner of Iomedae in each of the Crusades into the worldwound, standing apart in their dedication to the will of The Inheritor. Born in an unprecedented time of peace, Eldon Aegis bore the weight of his ancestry and feared that he may never live up to his family name. Now, as the worldwound once again threatens to swallow Kenabres whole, he must prove he has what it takes to take on the family mantle. As the Aegis family motto goes:
