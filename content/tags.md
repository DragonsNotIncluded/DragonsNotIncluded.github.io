The legends recorded here would be difficult to explore without a map, so please use our #tags to help you search our website's content!

Every post and page has a few #tags assigned, according to which characters or types of media appear on it. These can help you cross-reference your favourite heroes or events. 

Keep an eye out for #tags signposting you at the top of every post, and the tag cloud at the bottom of every page.
